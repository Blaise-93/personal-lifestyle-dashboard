# Coulture

An incredible project which I created out of my desire to make clients want 
to come back for more. This project was inspired by my dream for easiness of
having a rich screensaver/wallpaper which a user can change at anytime
depending on his multiple preference via refreshing the site at ease 
which most sites don't have.

It also has a movielist link to allow clients have enrich access to multiple
of movies to watch in the feature. The user can search the movie via our 
search button, select and add the movie to their watchlists which will
 be saved to their devices and they can equally delete the movies whenever
they want on watchlist url.


__Other Features__:
- View bitcoin market value in real time when coulture homepage is on display.
- Change the color theme of bitcoin market capitalization when the user 
    hovers on it. Thus optimizing the visual effect of the user.
- Have an access to `time diplay` no matter the user location in the world,
 thus displaying each user timezone in real-time. This is made possible because
  I used `toLocaleTimeString` method during the course of Coulture development.
- View motivational quotes at each time when the user is on the homepage which 
gets updated every 12 hours by itself, thanks to Javascript ` setInterval` method.
- The user owns the site via having full control where saved  watchlist movies
 are stored and when to delete them. This is made possible because I used 
 `Windows localstorage functionalities` which in turn could be of help as a 
 developer not to have worries which database to use or not. Local storage was
  really used because the data retrieved from OMDAPI is entirely insensitive data. 
So in my opinion, it is a win-win situation between myself and the user.
- Anytime the user want to add or delete a movie, add or delete icons will 
automatically appear which fades away in 1900 milliseconds, this functionality 
will increase user experience when performing the said tasks in our website.
Thus, making the user have that assured feeling that yes my movie was
 added/saved successfully.
- Navigation to different `URLs` is done at ease by the user back and
 forth with enrich theme color for UI/UX by the user.
- [Search functionality](./md-images/customized-search-icon.png) is heavily 
improved with a search icon, and search button to increase the user 
experience based on the user keystroke on the search-bar for the movie the user 
wants which displays all the available movies with that keystroke input by the
 user,and if the movie is not available, ofcourse the `catch block` error 
 method will display the error messgase of unavailability of the movie.

### __Responsive Web Design Implementations:__
 As a fullstack developer, I am aware that working on this side project, 
 Coulture, I don't have a UX/UI designer which a heavily available in companies
 during project development. My work as a software Engineer is to give live to
 the mock up design made available by UX/UI designer. Since I don't have that 
 personnel at my disposal, I have to hone the task by myself via following
 design fundamental rules throughout the course of the project. Thanks
 to my sound knowledge too on UI/UX design as a certified proffesional 
 in that angle. 
 Thus, I implemented semantic html markup and the 7 fundamental user interface designs which are
  *Alignment, Typography, Whitespace, Contrast, Scale, Color and Visual Hierrachy* 
in my project to make it looks great on both large, medium and small devices of
the user.


#### On Large Devices: eg Laptops, Desktop


#### On Medium Devices: 


#### On Small Devices: Mobile Phones
