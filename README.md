# Coulture

An incredible project which I created out of my desire to make clients want to come back for more. This project was inspired by my dream for easiness of having a rich screensaver/wallpaper which a user can change at anytime depending on his multiple preference via refreshing the site at ease which most sites don't have.

It also has a movielist link to allow clients have enrich access to multiple
of movies to watch in the feature. The user can search the movie via our search button, select and add the movie to their watchlists which will be saved to their devices and they can equally delete the movies whenever they want on watchlist url.
